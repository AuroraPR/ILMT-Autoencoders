# ILT-Autoencoders (Indoor Location Multioccupancy Tracking using Autoencoders)

This work explores the integration of millimetre wave (mmWave) Radar and minimal Ultra-Wideband (UWB) device configuration for enhanced tracking of multiple occupants in real domestic environments. Using a low-cost, non-intrusive, and quickly deployable device setup, our approach addresses the challenges of multi-occupant tracking with a focus on privacy and ease of installation. Initially, mmWave Radar identifies the presence of occupants with high precision but lacks individual recognition and limited sensitivity. By incorporating a minimal configuration of UWB (wearable tags and ambient anchors), we include identification through signal strength measurements, bypassing complex localisation needs. In addition, we propose several autoencoder models to fuse data from these diverse sources. Experiments carried out in two real-world domestic settings that involve up to three inhabitants per room showcase the ability of the proposal to combine mmWave and UWB technologies for indoor multioccupant tracking, suggesting promising applications in smart homes and ambient assisted living.
